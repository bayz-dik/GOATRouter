## Verified totals

- `@bayz/storage`: 157 tests pass (schema is now v4).
- `@bayz/providers`: 111 tests pass.
- `@bayz/proxy`: 105 tests pass.
- `@bayz/router`: 122 tests pass.
- `@bayz/server`: 14 tests pass (includes the `/api/health` Phase 1 contract guard).
- `@bayz/contracts`: 3, `@bayz/security`: 6, `@bayz/dashboard`: 2.
- `npm run runtime:verify` exits 0; all eight builds exit 0.
- `node scripts/storage-smoke.mjs`: 42/42 against a real database, including a
  reopen in a separate child process.
- `node scripts/provider-smoke.mjs`: 36/36 against a real database, a real
  loopback HTTP upstream, real `fetch`, and a separate-process reopen.
- `node scripts/proxy-smoke.mjs`: 39/39 against a real database plus real SOCKS5
  and HTTP `CONNECT` servers, completing real tunneled HTTP requests.
- `node scripts/router-smoke.mjs`: 46/46 against a real database, four real
  origins, and a real `CONNECT` proxy — proving a direct chat, a proxied chat,
  failover, `auth_failed` stopping the walk, and prompt/completion/credential
  absence from disk and logs.
- Live boot on `127.0.0.1:20996`: logged
  `{schemaVersion:3, journalMode:"wal", driver:"node:sqlite", keyProvider:"environment", keyId:"kek_…"}`
  at the time of Phase 4; schema is v4 as of Phase 5. `/api/health` still returns
  exactly `{status, version, uptimeSeconds}`.
- Secret scan over tracked non-test source for `sk-live`, `sk-router`, `hunter2`,
  `PROMPT-`, `BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY`, and `AIza…`: no matches.
- Getter scan for `getCredential`/`getPassword` across all `src`: no matches.
- `node:sqlite` imported in exactly one file, enforced by a source-scan test.
- `apps/dashboard` last touched in Phase 1 (`b78aef2`). No Flux Core or
  `BAYZ-responsive-master.html` file is tracked, so nothing there was modified.

## Environment facts

- Node `v24.19.0`, `linux arm64`. `node:sqlite` present, SQLite `3.53.3`, no
  ExperimentalWarning.
- Zero new dependencies added in Phases 2–5 — runtime or dev.
- scrypt measured on this device: N=2^14 49 ms/16 MiB, 2^15 95 ms/32 MiB,
  **2^16 194 ms/64 MiB (selected)**, 2^17 393 ms/128 MiB.

## Phase 2 architecture as built

```text
Domain (Provider Manager, Proxy Manager, Router, Usage, UI) — none exist yet
      ↓ sees only plain strings
SecureSecretRepository        packages/storage/src/secret-repository.ts
      ↓
CryptoEnvelope (KEK → per-secret DEK, AES-256-GCM, AAD name binding)
      ↓
KeyProvider + SqlDatabase
      ↓
SQLite adapter               packages/storage/src/drivers/node-sqlite.ts
```

`node:sqlite` is imported in exactly one file, enforced by a source-scanning
test. Migrations, repository, and crypto see only the `SqlDatabase` interface, so
a `better-sqlite3 → node:sqlite → sql.js` chain can be added later at
`selectDriver()` without touching the repository or domain API.

## Deviations from the plan text

1. **Plaintext framing byte.** AES-GCM of an empty string yields zero ciphertext
   bytes, indistinguishable from an emptied column. A `0x01` frame byte is
   prepended before encryption so an empty secret stays storable while an emptied
   ciphertext is still rejected as corrupt. Not in the plan; found by a test that
   demanded empty and absent be distinguishable.
2. **Database file modes.** The plan only specified `0700` on the directory and
   `0600` on the key file. A `0700` directory does not stop a backup tool from
   copying `bayz.db` out with loose permissions, so `bayz.db`, `-wal`, and `-shm`
   are chmod'ed `0600` too, best-effort.
3. **`SqlParam` excludes `boolean`.** `node:sqlite` rejects boolean bindings, so
   including it would have been a contract the first adapter cannot honor.
   Integers `0`/`1` are used instead.
4. **Smoke script self-relaunches with tsx.** The storage package is TypeScript,
   so `node scripts/storage-smoke.mjs` re-execs itself once with `--import tsx`
   rather than requiring callers to remember the flag.
5. **`isSecretKey` exported** from `@bayz/security` alongside `redactSecrets`.
   Additive; the Phase 1 public API and all Phase 1 assertions are unchanged.

## Phase 3 architecture as built

```text
ProviderManager               packages/providers/src/manager.ts
  ├─ ProviderRepository       registry rows, all values validated pre-SQL
  ├─ scopedSecretStorage      credential custody at provider:<id>:api_key
  └─ discovery (openai | gemini) over fetchJsonCapped
                              ↓ injected `fetcher`, AbortSignal.timeout, byte cap
                              upstream HTTP
```

The manager sees `SecretStorage` and a `SqlDatabase` interface — never a driver,
an envelope, a DEK, or a KEK. `node:sqlite` is still imported in exactly one
file, and the source-scan test that enforces it is unchanged.

## Phase 3 deviations from the plan text

1. **No zod.** The design sketch named zod for strict parsing. Adding it would
   have broken the zero-new-dependency rule that keeps Termux/ARM64 install-free,
   so validation is hand-rolled and typed instead. The guarantees are the ones
   zod would have provided: unknown keys rejected, ranges enforced, prototypes
   refused.
2. **`SecretStorage.sql` added.** Phase 3 needs the provider registry in the same
   database, with the same pragmas, as the credentials it points at. Exposing the
   existing `SqlDatabase` is additive and keeps the driver boundary intact; the
   alternative — a second connection — would have meant a second set of pragmas
   and a second lock holder.
3. **Timeout covers body streaming.** The plan bounded the request; a response
   that stalls after its headers also has to be bounded, so an abort during the
   capped read maps to `unreachable` rather than to a malformed payload.
4. **Discovery with zero usable entries fails.** Returning `[]` would make "the
   upstream has no models" indistinguishable from "every entry was malformed",
   which call for different operator action, so the latter raises
   `discovery_failed`.
5. **Phase 2 schema pin updated, not deleted.** The test that forbade a
   `providers` table was correct for Phase 2 and expired here. It now pins the v2
   column set and asserts no credential-like column exists; the bans on
   `proxies`, `routes`, `combos`, and `usage` are untouched.

## Phase 4 architecture as built

```text
ProxyManager                  packages/proxy/src/manager.ts
  ├─ ProxyRepository          registry rows, all values validated pre-SQL
  ├─ scopedSecretStorage      password custody at proxy:<id>:password
  └─ dialThroughProxy         kind dispatch → socks5Connect | httpConnect
                              ↓ bounded HandshakeReader, socket destroyed on failure
                              createProxyAgent → node:http / node:https
```

`HandshakeReader` is the security-relevant core: it reads exactly the bytes each
protocol stage requires and pushes leftovers back with `socket.unshift`, so a
proxy that coalesces its reply with the tunneled payload cannot leak handshake
bytes into the stream and a truncated reply cannot hang the client.

## Phase 4 deviations from the plan text

1. **`fetch` is not proxied, and this is stated rather than worked around.**
   Node's `fetch` is undici-backed with no stable public connector hook. Phase 4
   therefore ships a `node:http`/`node:https` agent — proven end-to-end against a
   real proxy and a real origin — and documents that provider discovery still goes
   out directly. Faking it with a global patch would have produced a proxy that
   silently stops working on a Node upgrade.
2. **`net.Server` has no `closeAllConnections`.** Every loopback test server
   tracks accepted sockets and destroys them before `close()`, or the suite hangs
   forever on a peer the test already abandoned. Discovered by an actual hang, not
   anticipated.
3. **Host validation trims before rejecting.** A trailing `\r\n` is whitespace and
   is trimmed; an *embedded* CRLF is rejected. Both behaviours are pinned by
   tests, because "reject anything containing CR" would refuse harmless pasted
   input while "strip all control characters" would silently accept an injection
   attempt.
4. **A password requires a username.** Neither RFC 1929 nor Basic proxy auth can
   send a password alone, so storing one would be dead, misleading state; the
   manager refuses it.
5. **`socks5Connect` refuses a server-selected method that was never offered.**
   Not in the plan, but accepting one would mean speaking a protocol variant that
   was never negotiated.

## Phase 5 architecture as built

```text
Router                        packages/router/src/router.ts
  ├─ RouteRepository          model→provider bindings, validated pre-SQL
  ├─ resolveCandidates        deterministic: specificity → priority → id
  ├─ providers.withCredential scoped lend, never a getter
  ├─ proxies.agentFor         proxy-bound routes traverse their proxy
  └─ sendChatRequest          node:http POST, byte-capped, strict response parse
```

The router closes the Phase 4 `fetch` gap for its own path: because it uses
`node:http`, the Phase 4 agent works and a proxied request genuinely tunnels.
Global `fetch` (still used by provider discovery) remains direct.

## Phase 5 deviations from the plan text

1. **`withCredential` instead of a getter.** The plan already called for this; the
   implementation detail worth recording is that the callback never runs when no
   credential is stored, so a caller cannot accidentally send an unauthenticated
   request believing it was signed. A corrupt credential raises `secret_corrupt`
   rather than being treated as absent.
2. **A disabled provider is skipped, not counted as a failed attempt.** The plan
   did not say which. Counting it would inflate `attempts` and imply a network
   call that never happened; if every candidate is skipped the result is
   `all_routes_failed` with a `chat-skipped-<n>` stage, which is distinct from
   `no_route` (routes exist, they are just unusable right now).
3. **Malformed `usage` degrades; malformed content does not.** Token counts are
   informational, so a bad `usage` block yields `undefined` instead of failing an
   otherwise good response. Content is not informational, so a bad content field
   is always a hard failure — never an empty string.
4. **Model ids reject `//` and `:/` beyond the character class.** A name like
   `https://evil.example.com/m` otherwise passed the slug regex, and since the
   model is appended to a provider base URL it could have redirected the request.
   Found by a failing test, not anticipated.
5. **`(model, provider_id)` is unique.** The same model cannot be bound twice to
   one provider, which surfaced in the smoke script and is the correct constraint:
   two identical bindings would make selection order arbitrary.
6. **Route identity is immutable.** `id`, `model`, and `providerId` are not
   patchable, so an operator creates a new reviewable binding instead of silently
   repointing an existing one.

## Deliberately NOT implemented, and not faked

- **OS keychain custody** — `OsKeystoreKeyProvider` exists as an interface with
  `available: false` and a `loadKek()` that throws. Every platform option needs a
  native module, which would break the zero-native-dependency Termux baseline.
  Scheduled for the packaging phase.
- **Argon2id** — awaits a Termux-safe binding. The envelope's `kdf` field is
  reserved for it. scrypt is a real implementation, not a placeholder.
- **Full anti-rollback** — `keyId` detects a wrong key and casual tampering, but
  an attacker with write access can restore an older `bayz.db` wholesale. Real
  anti-rollback needs OS-backed monotonic secure storage.
- **Rotation operator surface** — `rotateRootKey` works and is tested; there is no
  route, CLI command, or UI for it.
- **Codex OAuth** — `codex-oauth` providers can be registered, but
  `setCredential` and `discoverModels` refuse with `unsupported_operation`. The
  device flow needs an external ChatGPT account, which is outside what can be
  verified here.
- **Provider HTTP surface** — the Provider Manager is a library API. There is no
  route, no CLI, and no dashboard control for creating providers or storing keys.
- **Proxied `fetch`** — see Phase 4 deviation 1. `node:http`/`node:https` through
  `agentFor()` is real and proven; global `fetch` is still direct.
- **SOCKS4/4a, proxy chaining, PAC files, UDP ASSOCIATE/BIND, TLS-to-proxy** —
  none implemented. Only SOCKS5 `CONNECT` and HTTP `CONNECT` exist.
- **Streaming (SSE)** — not implemented. `stream: true` is *rejected*, not
  ignored, so no caller can believe it is streaming when it is not. A correct
  implementation needs incremental parsing plus cancellation semantics.
- **Combos (multi-provider fan-out) and usage accounting** — not implemented, and
  no schema for either exists. A migration test asserts the tables are absent.
- **Router HTTP surface** — the Router is a library API. There is no route, no
  CLI, and no dashboard control for chatting or managing routes.
- **Combo / usage schema** — a test asserts these tables do *not* exist, so
  speculative schema cannot creep in.

## Phase 5 residual risk

Protected: prompts and completions are never persisted or logged (proven against
raw database bytes and captured logs), no credential can be read out of any
manager, failover never carries one provider's credential to another, a corrupt
credential fails the request instead of silently going unauthenticated, an
upstream cannot inject fields into a router result or reach `Object.prototype`,
response sizes are capped, model names cannot escape into a URL, and route
selection is deterministic and explainable.

Not protected: an operator who binds a model to a provider pointing at an internal
address will reach it — that is an admin capability, not an SSRF guard. Prompts
still travel to whatever upstream the operator configured, in plaintext if that
upstream is `http`. There is no per-route rate limit and no request-level audit
trail (deliberately, since an audit trail would mean storing prompts).

## Phase 4 residual risk

Protected: a stolen `bayz.db` yields no proxy password, one proxy's password
cannot be reached through another, a tampered password fails closed instead of
reading as absent, a hostile proxy cannot exhaust memory or hang the client
through the handshake, CRLF and URL smuggling into a `CONNECT` request line or a
SOCKS5 domain field are impossible, and a proxy that declines authentication never
receives the password.

Not protected: Basic proxy auth over a plaintext `http` proxy is observable on the
path — base64 is encoding, not encryption. There is also no egress allowlist, so an
operator who registers a proxy pointing at an internal address will reach it; that
is a deliberate admin capability, not an SSRF guard.

## Phase 3 residual risk

Protected: a stolen `bayz.db` still yields no credential, one provider's key
cannot be read through another, a tampered credential fails closed instead of
reading as absent, a hostile upstream cannot flood memory or inject a model id,
and no credential reaches a URL, a log line, or an error message.

Not protected: an operator who configures a base URL pointing at an internal
address will have discovery reach it — this is a deliberate admin capability, not
an SSRF guard, since the base URL is operator-supplied by design. There is also no
egress allowlist and no per-provider rate limit yet.

## Residual risk, stated honestly

Protected: stolen `bayz.db` or backup, database inspection without the key,
ciphertext tampering, envelope relocation between records, single-DEK compromise,
accidental log/error/API disclosure.

Not protected: root or kernel-level attacker on the device, malicious code inside
the Bayz process, compromised dependency or build, hardware/OS compromise while
unlocked, database rollback, and guaranteed memory zeroization (buffers are
zeroed, but the GC may have copied them and immutable strings cannot be wiped).

## DEFERRED — blocked until the original UI/Sites source is added here

The private BAYZ Sites/UI review surface is **still not present** in this
workspace. `BAYZ-responsive-master.html`, the Sites build, and the Next.js root
`package.json` scripts have not been merged in.

These checks are DEFERRED and have **not** been verified. They are not passing:

- Root Sites build. `npm run build` at the root fails with
  `Missing script: "build"` because no Sites source exists.
- Foundation phase item "The existing root Sites build still passes."
- Merging the approved workspace fields into the real Next.js root
  `package.json` without discarding its existing scripts/dependencies.

`apps/dashboard` is the runtime foundation shell only. It is **not** a redesign
and does **not** replace `BAYZ-responsive-master.html` as the locked visual
source of truth. Phases 2–5 made no dashboard change whatsoever
(`git log -- apps/dashboard` still ends at the Phase 1 commit `b78aef2`). The
Flux Core animation remains LOCKED and untouched; no Flux source file is tracked
in this workspace.

## Resume steps once the real BAYZ repo/UI is available

1. Copy the Sites/UI source and the real root `package.json` into this workspace.
2. Merge the workspace fields (`workspaces`, `runtime:*` scripts) into the real
   root `package.json` instead of overwriting it.
3. Move the README runtime, storage, provider, proxy, and router sections into the
   real README.
4. Run the root Sites build and confirm it still exits 0.
5. Re-run `npm run runtime:verify` and all four smoke scripts.

## Next phase

Phase 6 is the HTTP API surface: an authenticated local API over the Provider,
Proxy, and Router managers, plus an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`
endpoint. It is the first phase that exposes any of this to a network listener, so
authentication and loopback binding are its central concerns — every manager so
far has deliberately stayed a library API for exactly that reason.
